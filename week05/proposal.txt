CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

Weather Prediction

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

Creating a learning model to check for accuracy of weather predictions based on historical data.
Predicting weather is an important task that impacts virtually every aspect of a community. Having additional data points
which can verify accuracy of suggested predictions only serves to increase confidence in weather forecast.


3. What will you learn from developing this program?
How to incorporate machine learning into a program

4. What Python modules will your program use?

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

    pandas
    sklearn
    matplotlib
    joblib


5. List the names of functions you will need?

    (Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and
    don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result.
    Functions that get user input and print results are important and do
    useful work but are not easily reusable.)

    (Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input
    and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user
    input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return
    a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program functions
    to have parameters and return a result.)

    clean_format_data_frame
    create_target_predictor
    create_train_set
    create_test_set
    predict
    test_prediction_accuracy
    combine_prediction_actuals
    plot_comparison

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.

    test_clean_format_data_frame
    test_create_train_set
    test_create_test_set
