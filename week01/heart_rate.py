"""When you physically exercise to strengthen your heart, 
you should maintain your heart rate within a range for at 
least 20 minutes. To find that range, subtract your age 
from 220. This difference is your maximum heart rate per 
minute. Your heart simply will not beat faster than this 
maximum (220 - age). When exercising to strengthen your 
heart, you should keep your heart rate between 65% and 
85% of your heartâ€™s maximum rate."""
